# Welcome to RethinkSec!

RethinkSec is a website that will share the basic to advanced knowledge in cybersecurity, mainly for the new joiners in cybersecurity, or those who want to refresh their mind in cybersecurity.

## What do I share here?

Normally I will be sharing multiple writeups, including, but not limited to:
- [Cybersecurity Fundamentals](cybersecurity-fundamentals/)
- [Penetration Testing](penetration-testing/)
- [Digital Forensic](digital-forensic/)
- [Malware Analysis](malware-analysis/)

However, due to my full-time job, this will not be always updated, will only be updating whenever I have free time.
